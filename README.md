### Signals and Systems Course Description

1. **Introduction to Signals and Systems**  
   This chapter provides an introduction to various types of signals, systems, and key properties of systems such as memory and causality.

2. **Linear Time-Invariant Systems**  
   A detailed examination of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems is presented in this chapter.

3. **Fourier Series for Periodic Signals**  
   This chapter introduces the Fourier Series for periodic signals, covering both continuous-time and discrete-time cases.

4. **Fourier Transform**  
   This chapter covers the Fourier Transform and its properties.

5. **Laplace Transform**  
   An introduction to the Laplace Transform and its properties.

6. **Discrete Fourier Transform**  
   This chapter introduces the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its properties.

7. **Z-Transform**  
   The Z-Transform is introduced as a generalization of the Discrete Fourier Transform, along with its properties.

8. **Sampling**  
   This chapter discusses the concept of sampling as a bridge between continuous and discrete signals, examining the relationships between their Fourier Transforms.

9. **2D Fourier Transform Simulations**  
   A brief section that highlights the effects of amplitude and phase in 2D signals through simulations.
