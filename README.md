### Signals and Systems Course Description

1. [**Introduction to Signals and Systems**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap1_14002.pdf)
   This chapter provides an introduction to various types of signals, systems, and key properties of systems such as memory and causality.

2. [**Linear Time-Invariant Systems**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap2_14002.pdf)
   A detailed examination of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems is presented in this chapter.

3. [**Fourier Series for Periodic Signals**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap3_14002.pdf)
   This chapter introduces the Fourier Series for periodic signals, covering both continuous-time and discrete-time cases.

4. [**Fourier Transform**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap4_14002.pdf)
   This chapter covers the Fourier Transform and its properties.

5. [**Laplace Transform**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap5_14002.pdf)
   An introduction to the Laplace Transform and its properties.

6. [**Discrete Fourier Transform**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap6_14002.pdf)
   This chapter introduces the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its properties.

7. [**Z-Transform**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap7_14002.pdf)
   The Z-Transform is introduced as a generalization of the Discrete Fourier Transform, along with its properties.

8. [**Sampling**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap8_14002.pdf)
   This chapter discusses the concept of sampling as a bridge between continuous and discrete signals, examining the relationships between their Fourier Transforms.

9. [**2D Fourier Transform Simulations**](https://github.com/MoTa2380/Signals-and-Systems-Course/blob/main/slides/Signal_System_Chap9_14002.pdf)
   A brief section that highlights the effects of amplitude and phase in 2D signals through simulations.
